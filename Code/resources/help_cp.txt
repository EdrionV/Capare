                                        In C.A.P.A.R.E., we have made sure that you get all the information needed right away, for a specific situation.
                                        Whether it be attacking your enemy or picking up an item, every command and its use will be mentioned before you,
                                                                 so you will rarely find a situation where you will not know what to do.

                                        During some fight scenes, there will be moments where you will have to just wait and watch what happens as both you and
                                       your enemy are in combat and trying to kill each other and ultimately the score(health) gets displayed and decides who won

                                        We also have given you option to exit the game at all times, so feel free to restart your journey with better performance
